Testing libblkid for invalid udev data when initializing a device



1. Add a udev rule, saved as
"/etc/udev/rules.d/<testdevice>_phantom_uninit.rules":

ENV{DEVNAME}=="/dev/loop0", ENV{ID_FS_USAGE}="", ENV{ID_FS_TYPE}="", ENV{ID_PART_TABLE_TYPE}=""

(NOTE: change the device name to the path of the desired test device, which
will be overwritten during this test.)


2. Initialize the test device as LUKS2:

cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/loop0


3. Attempt a stratis pool create with the device:

stratis pool create testpool /dev/loop0


RESULT:

The "stratis pool create" command should fail with the following error:

stratisd failed to perform the operation that you requested. It returned the
following information via the D-Bus: ERROR: At least one of the devices
specified was unsuitable for initialization: Device /dev/loop0 was reported to
be unowned by udev but actually contains existing partitions or superblock;
partitions: None, superblock: Some("crypto_LUKS").

NOTE: the error message should indicate that the device is "reported to be
unowned by udev", but appears to contain existing partitions or a superblock.
